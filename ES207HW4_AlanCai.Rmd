#14.3.1.1 Exercises
```{r}
# 1. "\" doesn't work because it will be interpreted as an escape from the character that follows it.
# "\\" doesn't work because that is equivalent to the string "\", but that is the special behavior \ not the literal \.
# "\\\" doesn't work because that is equivalent to the escaped special behavior of the string "\", but of what?  There is nothing to the right of it for it to do the escape thing on.

#2. str_view(x, ""\"'\\\\")

# 3. It will search for 5 character sequences where the five characters are as follows:
# Character one: .
# Character two: any character
# Character three: .
# Character four: any character
# Character five: .
# Represent as a string: \\..\\..\\.
```

#14.3.2.1 Exercises

str_view(stringr::words, "^y", match = TRUE)

str_detect(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")
#1.3)

#3.
str_view(stringr::words, "q[^u]", match = TRUE) #returns nothing.
#4.
str_view(stringr::words, "our$", match = TRUE) 
#5. "(\d)(\d)(\d)- (\d)(\d)(\d)- (\d)(\d)(\d)(\d)"

```

#14.3.4.1 Exercises

```{r}
# 1. ? - {0, 1}
#    + - {1, }
#    * - {0, }
# 
# 2. 1) Any expression.  .* allows for zero or more of any character expect a newline.
#       2) .+ allows for one or more of any characters expect for a newline.  The \\ is a double escape from } so it is looking for           the literal character }.  Same with \\{ - looking for the literal character {.  So {X} where X can be zero or more of any             character except a newline.
#       3) \d{4} is any four digits.  So any four digits, followed by a -, followed by any 2 digits, followed by a =, followed by any 2       digits.
#       4) \\\\ is a literal \.  So 4 consecutive literal backslashes.
# 
# 3.  1) $[^aeiou]{3}
#     2) [aeiou]{3,}
#     3) (([aeiou])([^aeiou])){2,}
# 
# 4. Yes.

```

#14.3.5.1 Exercises

```{r}
# 1. 1) any four consecutive same characters.
#    2) one character, followed by two of the same character.  This combined thing repeated once.
#    3) any two characters, repeated once. (ABAB)
#    4) any character "X", followed by any character, followed by X again, followed by any character.  This entire thing twice.
#    5) Any character "A" followed by zero or more of any character.  That repeated three times.  All of that preceded by any       character "B".  All of that repeated twice.  All of that preceded by any character "C'.  All of that repeated once.
